			<h1>Setting up an Apache Tomcat web server with Linux</h1>
		</div>


		<div id="p-container">
			<p>Tomcat is the most popular server for Java web apps. It uses a
				web server named Coyote and a servlet/JSP engine called Catalina</p>

			<p>For this tutorial we're going to use a Raspberry Pi as the
				Linux host machine. A Raspberry Pi is a microcomputer which can use
				any Linux distribution as it's OS, but for this tutorial any Linux
				distribution can be used.</p>

			<img src="images/r-pi.jpeg">

			<p>We are going to connect remotely to the R-Pi as a headless
				machine using the secure shell protocol (SSH). You just need to
				connect your R-Pi to a router, open the terminal window and get its
				local IP through:</p>

			<div class="code-div">
				<code>hostname -I </code>
			</div>
			<p>Access remotely with the ssh command:</p>

			<div class="code-div">
				<code>ssh remote@&lt;ip-number&gt;</code>
			</div>

			<p>Type remote login and password</p>

		</div>

	</div>

	<div class="step1">

		<div class="title-div">
			<h1>Downloading and installing Tomcat</h1>
		</div>

		<img src="images/logo-apache-tomcat.png">

		<div id="p-container">
			<p>To install tomcat you need to type in the command line
				interface the following (replace the X's with the version of Tomcat
				you're trying to install):</p>

			<div class="code-div">
				<code>wget
					http://mirrors.axint.net/apache/tomcat/tomcat-X/vX.0.XX/bin/apache-tomcat-X.X.XX.tar.gz
				</code>
			</div>

			<p>Then you need to extract the file with the tar program:</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code> tar xzf apache-tomcat-X.X.XX.tar.gz </code>
			</div>

			<p>Change your current dir with command cd to where tomcat users
				autorization file is, it should be at /conf/:</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code>cd apache-tomcat-X.X.XX/conf</code>
			</div>

			<p>Now we must add autorization to the user in the
				tomcat-users.xml file. I'm going to use nano text editor but you can
				use vim or any other text editor you like</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code>nano tomcat-users.xml</code>
			</div>

			<p>Add you user to the authorization file, directly below
				&lt;tomcat-users&gt; add:</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code>&lt;user username="system" password="raspberry"
					roles="manager-gui"/&gt;</code>
			</div>


		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="step2">

		<div class="title-div">
			<h1>Start up Tomcat</h1>
		</div>

		<div id="p-container">
			<p>Now go to Tomcat binaries dir:</p>

			<div class="code-div">
				<code> cd ../bin </code>
			</div>

			<p>Now type the command to startup Tomcat</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code>sudo sh startup.sh</code>
			</div>

			<p>Now you should be able to use Tomcat, go to your browser and
				type:</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code>http://&lt;your-ip&gt;:8080/</code>
			</div>

			<p>If you see the following in your browser it means your tomcat
				server is working!!!</p>

			<h1>Understanding Tomcat directory structure</h1>
		</div>

		<div id="p-container">
			<p>Tomcat's subdirs are organized in the following way:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>bin:</b> Files for working with Tomcat such as startup
					and shutdown batch file</li>
				<li><b>conf:</b> Files for configuring Tomcat such as
					server.xml, context.xml and web.xml</li>
				<li><b>lib:</b> JAR file that contain classes that are
					available to all web apps or that we need to make available for our
					web apps.</li>
				<li><b>logs:</b> Log files</li>
				<li><b>temp:</b> Temporary files used by the JVM</li>
				<li><b>webapps:</b> The dirs and source code files for the
					webapps</li>
				<li><b>work:</b> The source code and class files for the
					servlets that Tomcat generates for the JSPs.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="step3">

		<div class="title-div">
			<h1>Deploying web apps in Tomcat from the Command Line</h1>
		</div>

		<div id="p-container">
			<p>You can move your WAR (Web Application Archive file) to
				Tomcat's webapps sub directory and leave there the WAR file, Tomcat
				will automatically extract it's contents and use them for the
				webapplication</p>
			<p>You can create a WAR file from the command line. First change
				to the directory with the source files you want to compress into a
				WAR file, then type:</p>

			<div class="code-div">
				<code> jar -cvf example.war * </code>
			</div>

			<p>Now you have your WAR file ready. Let's review the recommended
				WAR file directory structure</p>

			<h2>WAR file Standard Directory Layout</h2>

			<p>The following is the recommended struture for a WAR file this
				are the files and sub directories that should go in the root folder
				of the WAR:</p>

			<p>*.html, *.jsp, etc. - The HTML and JSP pages, along with other
				files that must be visible to the client browser (such as
				JavaScript, stylesheet files, and images) for your application. In
				larger applications you may choose to divide these files into a
				subdirectory hierarchy, but for smaller apps, it is generally much
				simpler to maintain only a single directory for these files.</p>

			<p>/WEB-INF - This dir must contain a fine named web.xml. this
				file can be used to configure the servlets and other components that
				make up the application. In addition, this dir is not directly
				accesible from the web.</p>


			<p>/WEB-INF/web.xml - The Web Application Deployment Descriptor
				for your application. This is an XML file describing the servlets
				and other components that make up your application, along with any
				initialization parameters and container-managed security constraints
				that you want the server to enforce for you. This file is discussed
				in more detail in the following subsection.</p>

			<p>/WEB-INF/classes/ - This directory contains any Java class
				files (and associated resources) required for your application,
				Servlet Classes and non-servlet classes, that are not combined into
				JAR files. If your classes are organized into Java packages, you
				must reflect this in the directory hierarchy under
				/WEB-INF/classes/. For example, a Java class named
				com.mycompany.mypackage.MyServlet would need to be stored in a file
				named /WEB-INF/classes/com/mycompany/mypackage/MyServlet.class.</p>

			<p>/WEB-INF/lib/ - This directory contains JAR files that contain
				Java class files (and associated resources) required for your
				application, such as third party class libraries or JDBC drivers.</p>

			<p>/META-INF - This dir contains the context.xml.file. Which can
				be used to configure the web app context.</p>


		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="step2">

		<div class="title-div">
			<h1>Making your web server accesible to the world</h1>
		</div>

		<div id="p-container">
			<p>Now that you got Tomcat installed and understand it better, we
				can change Tomcat to work with port 80 instead of port 8080 this
				will save some typing when accesing the web apps in the server.</p>

			<p>Change ports used by Tomcat in server.xml at:</p>


			<div class="code-div">
				<code>cd tomcat/work/server.xml</code>
			</div>

			<p>Now change all instances of port 8080 to port 80</p>

			<p>Now you should be able to access sample file without typing
				port 8080, go to you browser and type:</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code>http://&lt;your-ip&gt;:80/</code>
			</div>

			<p>This is the same as typing in your browser without :80 part:</p>
			<div class="code-div">
				<code>http://&lt;your-ip&gt;/</code>
			</div>

			<p>Once again you should be able to see Tomcat's standard page:</p>
			<img src="images/success.png">
			<p>The final 2 steps you should access your router configure port
				forwarding into letting port 80 request access your server and
				finally disabling your firewalls</p>
			<p>This last 2 steps are dependent of your routers brand so make
				a google search for this part</p>

			<p>Congratulations!!! Now your home webserver with a Raspberry Pi
				is ready to be accesed from any part of the world</p>
